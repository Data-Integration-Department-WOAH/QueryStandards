<p><strong>Chapter, Section, Page:</strong> Foreword, Page vii <strong>Full Paragraph:</strong> The Terrestrial Animal Health Code (the Terrestrial Code) provides standards for the improvement of animal health, animal welfare and veterinary public health worldwide. These standards should be used by Members to set up measures for the prevention, early detection, <strong>reporting</strong> and control of pathogenic agents in terrestrial animals (mammals, reptiles, birds and bees), including zoonotic agents. Implementation of the recommendations in the Terrestrial Code ensures the safety of international trade in animals and animal products, while avoiding unjustified sanitary barriers.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter, Section, Page:</strong> Chapter 1.1. Notification of diseases and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.2, Page 1 <strong>Full Paragraph:</strong> To assist in the clear and concise exchange of information, <strong>reports</strong> shall conform as closely as possible to the WOAH disease <strong>reporting</strong> format.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter, Section, Page:</strong> Chapter 1.1. Notification of diseases and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.2, Page 1 <strong>Full Paragraph:</strong> The detection of the pathogenic agent of a listed disease in an animal should be <strong>reported</strong>, even in the absence of clinical signs. Recognising that scientific knowledge concerning the relationship between diseases and their pathogenic agents is constantly developing and that the presence of a pathogenic agent does not necessarily imply the presence of a disease, Member Countries shall ensure, through their <strong>reports</strong>, that they comply with the spirit and intention of point 1 above.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter, Section, Page:</strong> Chapter 1.1. Notification of diseases and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.3, Page 2 <strong>Full Paragraph:</strong> <strong>weekly reports</strong> subsequent to a notification under point 1 above, to provide further information on the evolution of the event which justified the notification.

<p><strong>Chapter, Section, Page:</strong> Chapter 1.4. Animal health surveillance, Article 1.4.4, Page 10 <strong>Full Paragraph:</strong> 1. Disease <strong>reporting</strong> systems Disease <strong>reporting</strong> systems are based on <strong>reporting</strong> of animal health-related events to the Veterinary Authority. Data derived from disease <strong>reporting</strong> systems can be used in combination with other data sources to substantiate claims of animal health status, to generate data for risk analysis or for early warning and response. Effective laboratory support is an important component of any <strong>reporting</strong> system. <strong>Reporting</strong> systems relying on laboratory confirmation of suspected clinical cases should use tests that have high specificity as described in the Terrestrial Manual. Whenever the responsibility for disease <strong>reporting</strong> falls outside the scope of the Veterinary Authority, for example human cases of zoonotic diseases or infections or infestations in wildlife, effective communication and data sharing should be established between the Veterinary Authority and other relevant authorities. Participatory surveillance methods may be useful to collect epidemiological data that can support disease <strong>reporting</strong> systems.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter, Section, Page:</strong> Chapter 1.4. Animal health surveillance, Article 1.4.5, Page 13 <strong>Full Paragraph:</strong> An early warning system is essential for the timely detection, <strong>reporting</strong> and communication of occurrence, incursion or emergence of diseases, infections or infestations and is an integral component of emergency preparedness. It should be under the control of the Veterinary Authority and should include the following: 1) appropriate access to, and authority over, the target animal populations by the Veterinary Services; 2) access to laboratories capable of diagnosing and differentiating relevant infections or infestations; 3) training and awareness programmes for veterinarians, veterinary paraprofessionals, animal owners or keepers and others involved in handling animals at the farm or other places where they are kept during their transport or at the slaughterhouse/abattoir, for detecting and <strong>reporting</strong> unusual animal health incidents; 4) a legal obligation by veterinarians and other relevant stakeholders to <strong>report</strong> suspected cases or cases of notifiable diseases or emerging diseases to the Veterinary Authority, including the description of the findings; 5) epidemiological investigations of suspected cases and cases conducted by the Veterinary Services in order to confirm cases and to acquire accurate knowledge of the situation for further action. All suspected case investigations should provide a result, either positive or negative. Criteria should be established in advance for a case definition. Confirmation can be made on clinical and post-mortem grounds, epidemiological information, laboratory test results or a combination of these, in accordance with relevant articles of the Terrestrial Code or Terrestrial Manual; 6) effective systems of communication between the Veterinary Authority and relevant stakeholders; 7) a national chain of command.</p>
