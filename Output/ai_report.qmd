## Findings for 'report'

**Chapter, Section, Page:** Foreword, Page vii
**Full Paragraph:**
The Terrestrial Animal Health Code (the Terrestrial Code) provides standards for the improvement of animal health, animal welfare and veterinary public health worldwide. These standards should be used by Members to set up measures for the prevention, early detection, **reporting** and control of pathogenic agents in terrestrial animals (mammals, reptiles, birds and bees), including zoonotic agents. Implementation of the recommendations in the Terrestrial Code ensures the safety of international trade in animals and animal products, while avoiding unjustified sanitary barriers.

**Chapter, Section, Page:** User's guide, B. Terrestrial Code content, Page ix
**Full Paragraph:**
Veterinary Authorities should use the standards in the Terrestrial Code to set up measures providing for early detection, internal **reporting**, notification, control or eradication of pathogenic agents, including zoonotic ones, in terrestrial animals (mammals, birds, reptiles and bees) and preventing their spread via international trade in animals and animal products, while avoiding unjustified sanitary barriers to trade.

**Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1. Notification of diseases and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.2, Page 1
**Full Paragraph:**
For the purposes of this chapter, an “event” means a single outbreak or a group of epidemiologically related outbreaks of a given listed disease or emerging disease that is the subject of a notification. An event is specific to a pathogenic agent and strain, when appropriate, and includes all related outbreaks **reported** from the time of the initial notification through to the final **report**. **Reports** of an event include susceptible species, the number and geographical distribution of affected animals and epidemiological units.

**Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1. Notification of diseases and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.2, Page 1

**Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1. Notification of diseases and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.2, Page 1
**Full Paragraph:**
The detection of the pathogenic agent of a listed disease in an animal should be **reported**, even in the absence of clinical signs. Recognising that scientific knowledge concerning the relationship between diseases and their pathogenic agents is constantly developing and that the presence of a pathogenic agent does not necessarily imply the presence of a disease, Member Countries shall ensure, through their **reports**, that they comply with the spirit and intention of point 1 above.

**Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1. Notification of diseases and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.3, Page 2

**weekly reports** subsequent to a notification under point 1 above, to provide further information on the evolution of the event which justified the notification. These **reports** should continue until the listed disease has been eradicated or the situation has become sufficiently stable that six-monthly **reporting** under point 3 will satisfy the obligation of the Member Country. For each event notified, a final **report** should be submitted;

**Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1. Notification of diseases and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.3, Page 2

     OR
     b)   until sufficient scientific information is available to determine whether it meets the criteria for inclusion in the
          WOAH list as described in Chapter 1.2.;

**Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1. Notification of diseases and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.4, Page 2

**Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.4. Animal health surveillance, Article 1.4.4, Page 10
**Full Paragraph:**
1.   Disease **reporting** systems
     Disease **reporting** systems are based on **reporting** of animal health-related events to the Veterinary Authority. Data
     derived from disease **reporting** systems can be used in combination with other data sources to substantiate claims
     of animal health status, to generate data for risk analysis or for early warning and response. Effective laboratory
     support is an important component of any **reporting** system. **Reporting** systems relying on laboratory confirmation
     of suspected clinical cases should use tests that have high specificity as described in the Terrestrial Manual.
     Whenever the responsibility for disease **reporting** falls outside the scope of the Veterinary Authority, for example
     human cases of zoonotic diseases or infections or infestations in wildlife, effective communication and data sharing
     should be established between the Veterinary Authority and other relevant authorities.
     Participatory surveillance methods may be useful to collect epidemiological data that can support disease **reporting**
     systems.

**Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.4. Animal health surveillance, Article 1.4.5, Page 13
**Full Paragraph:**
An early warning system is essential for the timely detection, **reporting** and communication of occurrence, incursion or emergence of diseases, infections or infestations and is an integral component of emergency preparedness. It should be under the control of the Veterinary Authority and should include the following:
1)   appropriate access to, and authority over, the target animal populations by the Veterinary Services;
2)   access to laboratories capable of diagnosing and differentiating relevant infections or infestations;
3)   training and awareness programmes for veterinarians, veterinary paraprofessionals, animal owners or keepers and
     others involved in handling animals at the farm or other places where they are kept during their transport or at the
     slaughterhouse/abattoir, for detecting and **reporting** unusual animal health incidents;
4)   a legal obligation by veterinarians and other relevant stakeholders to **report** suspected cases or cases of notifiable
     diseases or emerging diseases to the Veterinary Authority, including the description of the findings;
5)   epidemiological investigations of suspected cases and cases conducted by the Veterinary Services in order to
     confirm cases and to acquire accurate knowledge of the situation for further action.
     All suspected case investigations should provide a result, either positive or negative. Criteria should be established
     in advance for a case definition. Confirmation can be made on clinical and post-mortem grounds, epidemiological
     information, laboratory test results or a combination of these, in accordance with relevant articles of the Terrestrial
     Code or Terrestrial Manual;
6)   effective systems of communication between the Veterinary Authority and relevant stakeholders;
7)   a national chain of command.
