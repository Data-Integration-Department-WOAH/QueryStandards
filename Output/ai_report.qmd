### Instance 2

-   **Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1.- Notification of diseases
    and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.2., Page 1
-   **Paragraph:**
    3)  For the purposes of this chapter, an “event” means a single
        outbreak or a group of epidemiologically related outbreaks of a
        given listed disease or emerging disease that is the subject of
        a notification. An event is specific to a pathogenic agent and
        strain, when appropriate, and includes all related outbreaks
        [reported]{style="background-color: yellow"} from the time of
        the initial notification through to the final
        [report]{style="background-color: yellow"}.

### Instance 4

-   **Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1.- Notification of diseases
    and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.2., Page 1
-   **Paragraph:**
    5)  The detection of the pathogenic agent of a listed disease in an
        animal should be [reported]{style="background-color: yellow"},
        even in the absence of clinical signs. Recognising that
        scientific knowledge concerning the relationship between
        diseases and their pathogenic agents is constantly developing
        and that the presence of a pathogenic agent does not necessarily
        imply the presence of a disease, Member Countries shall ensure,
        through their [reports]{style="background-color: yellow"}, that
        they comply with the spirit and intention of point 1 above.

### Instance 5

-   **Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1.- Notification of diseases
    and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.3., Page 2
-   **Paragraph:**
    2)  weekly [reports]{style="background-color: yellow"} subsequent to
        a notification under point 1 above, to provide further
        information on the evolution of the event which justified the
        notification. These [reports]{style="background-color: yellow"}
        should continue until the listed disease has been eradicated or
        the situation has become sufficiently stable that six-monthly
        [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} under point 3 will
        satisfy the obligation of the Member Country. For each event
        notified, a final [report]{style="background-color: yellow"}
        should be submitted;

### Instance 6

-   **Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1.- Notification of diseases
    and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.3., Page 2
-   **Paragraph:**
    3)  six-monthly [reports]{style="background-color: yellow"} on the
        absence or presence and evolution of listed diseases and
        information of epidemiological significance to other Member
        Countries;

### Instance 7

-   **Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.1.- Notification of diseases
    and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.3., Page 2

    and provision of epidemiological information, Article 1.1.4., Page 2
-   **Paragraph:**
    3)  a final [report]{style="background-color: yellow"} once point
        2 a) or 2 b) above has been complied with.

### Instance 10

-   **Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.4.- Animal health
    surveillance, Article 1.4.3., Page 9
-   **Paragraph:** The success of a surveillance system is dependent on
    a reliable process for data collection and management. The process
    may be based on paper or electronic records. Even where data are
    collected for non-survey purposes (e.g. during disease control
    interventions, inspections for movement control or during disease
    eradication schemes), the consistency and quality of data collection
    and event [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} in a format
    that facilitates analysis is critical. Software may offer the
    possibility of extraction of multiple source data for aggregation
    and analysis. Factors influencing the quality of collected data
    include: – the distribution of, and communication between, those
    involved in generating and transferring data from the field to a
    centralised location; this requires effective collaboration among
    all stakeholders, such as government or non-governmental
    organisations, and others, particularly for data involving wildlife;
    – the ability of the data processing system to detect missing,
    inconsistent or inaccurate data, and to address these problems; –
    maintenance of raw data rather than the compilation of summary data;
    – minimisation of transcription errors during data processing and
    communication.

### Instance 11

-   **Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.4.- Animal health
    surveillance, Article 1.4.4., Page 10
-   **Paragraph:**
    1.  Disease [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} systems

        Disease [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} systems
        are based on [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} of
        animal health-related events to the Veterinary Authority. Data
        derived from disease
        [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} systems can be
        used in combination with other data sources to substantiate
        claims of animal health status, to generate data for risk
        analysis or for early warning and response. Effective laboratory
        support is an important component of any
        [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} system.
        [Reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} systems relying on
        laboratory confirmation of suspected clinical cases should use
        tests that have high specificity as described in the Terrestrial
        Manual.

        Whenever the responsibility for disease
        [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} falls outside the
        scope of the Veterinary Authority, for example human cases of
        zoonotic diseases or infections or infestations in wildlife,
        effective communication and data sharing should be established
        between the Veterinary Authority and other relevant authorities.

        Participatory surveillance methods may be useful to collect
        epidemiological data that can support disease
        [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"} systems.

### Instance 12

-   **Chapter, Section, Page:** Chapter 1.4.- Animal health
    surveillance, Article 1.4.5., Page 13

        in handling animals at the farm or other places where they are
        kept during their transport or at the slaughterhouse/abattoir,
        for detecting and [reporting]{style="background-color: yellow"}
        unusual animal health incidents;
    4)  a legal obligation by veterinarians and other relevant
        stakeholders to [report]{style="background-color: yellow"}
        suspected cases or cases of notifiable diseases or emerging
        diseases to the Veterinary Authority, including the description
        of the findings;

        conducted by the Veterinary Services in order to confirm cases
        and to acquire accurate knowledge of the situation for further
        action. All suspected case investigations should provide a
        result, either positive or negative. Criteria should be

        be made on clinical and post-mortem grounds, epidemiological
        information, laboratory test results or a combination of these,
        in accordance with relevant articles of the Terrestrial Code or
        Terrestrial Manual;
    6)  effective systems of communication between the Veterinary
        Authority and relevant stakeholders;
    7)  a national chain of command.
